# MeshDataDeformer
MeshData deformer with job system and burst

How to use:
- Just add the deformer script component to a GameObject with meshfilter. It works on Unity sphere!

If you get some errors on buffer sizes inspect the mesh attributes! Maybe you have to remove new attributes for example uv2 or remove the tanget!
